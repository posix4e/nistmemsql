# NIST-Compatible In-Memory SQL Database

## Project Goal
Build a **FULL** NIST-compatible SQL:1999 parser and in-memory database implementation from scratch.

## Requirements (from upstream clarifications)
- **SQL Standard**: SQL:1999
- **Compliance Level**: FULL compliance (all mandatory and optional features)
- **Protocol Support**: NIST compatibility tests must run through both ODBC and JDBC
- **Language**: No preference (implementation choice is ours)
- **Test Suite**: [sqltest](https://github.com/elliotchance/sqltest) - comprehensive SQL conformance tests
- **Performance**: Not required - single-threaded is acceptable
- **Persistence**: None - purely in-memory, no WAL, ephemeral only

## High-Level Architecture

### Components Required
1. **SQL Parser** - Lexical analysis and parsing of SQL statements
2. **Query Planner** - Optimize and plan query execution
3. **Execution Engine** - Execute queries against in-memory storage
4. **Storage Engine** - In-memory data structures for tables, indexes, etc.
5. **ODBC/JDBC Interface** - Standard database connectivity protocols
6. **NIST Compliance Test Suite** - Automated validation of standard conformance

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core SQL Parser
- Lexer and tokenizer
- Parser for basic SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation
- Basic semantic analysis

### Phase 2: Storage Engine
- In-memory table storage
- Basic data types (INTEGER, VARCHAR, etc.)
- Row-based storage format
- Table metadata management

### Phase 3: Query Execution
- Simple query executor for basic SELECT
- WHERE clause evaluation
- Basic JOIN operations
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)

### Phase 4: SQL:1999 Specific Features
- Recursive queries (WITH RECURSIVE)
- CASE expressions
- Boolean data type
- Large object types (BLOB, CLOB)
- User-defined types
- Triggers and stored procedures
- Roles and privileges

### Phase 5: Advanced SQL:1999 Features
- Object-relational features (user-defined types, methods)
- Savepoints in transactions
- Multiple result sets
- Additional datetime types (TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL)
- SIMILAR TO pattern matching
- New built-in functions and operators

### Phase 6: Protocol Support (Critical for Testing)
- **ODBC interface implementation** - Required for NIST test execution
- **JDBC driver implementation** - Required for NIST test execution
- Network protocol handling
- Connection pooling and session management

### Phase 7: NIST Compliance Testing
- Integrate NIST SQL:1999 test suite
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Both ODBC and JDBC test execution paths
- Compliance reporting and gap analysis

## Development Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 0 - Planning and Architecture

**Completed**:
- âœ… Requirements clarification (via upstream GitHub issues)
- âœ… SQL:1999 standard research
- âœ… Testing strategy design
- âœ… Documentation infrastructure

**Next Steps**:
1. âœ… Language selection (Rust chosen - ADR-0001)
2. Parser strategy (ADR-0002) - pest vs lalrpop vs nom
3. Begin Phase 1: Core SQL Parser implementation
4. Integrate sqltest for continuous testing

## Key Findings

### ðŸŽ‰ MAJOR SIMPLIFICATIONS! (See [MAJOR_SIMPLIFICATIONS.md](MAJOR_SIMPLIFICATIONS.md))

All 7 upstream issues answered with **game-changing** clarifications:

1. **No Performance Requirements** âœ…
   - Single-threaded is fine
   - No query optimization needed
   - No WAL required
   - Simple algorithms acceptable

2. **No Persistence Required** âœ…
   - Purely ephemeral (in-memory only)
   - No disk I/O
   - No durability needed
   - Data lost on shutdown is fine

3. **Official Test Suite Identified** âœ…
   - [sqltest](https://github.com/elliotchance/sqltest) by Elliot Chance
   - Covers SQL:92, SQL:99, SQL:2003, SQL:2011, SQL:2016
   - BNF-driven test generation
   - Feature-organized, comprehensive

### Updated Scope Assessment
- **Original Estimate**: 92,000-152,000 LOC, 3-5 person-years
- **Revised Estimate**: 40,000-70,000 LOC, 1-2 person-years (**60-70% reduction!**)
- **With AI Assistance**: 6-12 months estimated
- **Complexity**: Massively reduced - focus on correctness only
- **Challenge**: Still FULL SQL:1999 compliance (unprecedented)

**Key Insight**: Eliminated ~60-70% of complexity by not needing performance, persistence, or test development!
