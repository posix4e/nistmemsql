# NIST-Compatible In-Memory SQL Database

## Project Goal
Build a **FULL** NIST-compatible SQL:1999 parser and in-memory database implementation from scratch.

## Requirements (from upstream clarifications)
- **SQL Standard**: SQL:1999
- **Compliance Level**: FULL compliance (all mandatory and optional features)
- **Protocol Support**: NIST compatibility tests must run through both ODBC and JDBC
- **Language**: No preference (implementation choice is ours)
- **Test Suite**: Must pass NIST compatibility tests via GitHub Actions

## High-Level Architecture

### Components Required
1. **SQL Parser** - Lexical analysis and parsing of SQL statements
2. **Query Planner** - Optimize and plan query execution
3. **Execution Engine** - Execute queries against in-memory storage
4. **Storage Engine** - In-memory data structures for tables, indexes, etc.
5. **ODBC/JDBC Interface** - Standard database connectivity protocols
6. **NIST Compliance Test Suite** - Automated validation of standard conformance

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core SQL Parser
- Lexer and tokenizer
- Parser for basic SQL statements (SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation
- Basic semantic analysis

### Phase 2: Storage Engine
- In-memory table storage
- Basic data types (INTEGER, VARCHAR, etc.)
- Row-based storage format
- Table metadata management

### Phase 3: Query Execution
- Simple query executor for basic SELECT
- WHERE clause evaluation
- Basic JOIN operations
- Aggregation functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)

### Phase 4: SQL:1999 Specific Features
- Recursive queries (WITH RECURSIVE)
- CASE expressions
- Boolean data type
- Large object types (BLOB, CLOB)
- User-defined types
- Triggers and stored procedures
- Roles and privileges

### Phase 5: Advanced SQL:1999 Features
- Object-relational features (user-defined types, methods)
- Savepoints in transactions
- Multiple result sets
- Additional datetime types (TIMESTAMP, INTERVAL)
- SIMILAR TO pattern matching
- New built-in functions and operators

### Phase 6: Protocol Support (Critical for Testing)
- **ODBC interface implementation** - Required for NIST test execution
- **JDBC driver implementation** - Required for NIST test execution
- Network protocol handling
- Connection pooling and session management

### Phase 7: NIST Compliance Testing
- Integrate NIST SQL:1999 test suite
- GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- Both ODBC and JDBC test execution paths
- Compliance reporting and gap analysis

- When and how to document

## Development Status

**Current Phase**: Phase 0 - Planning and Architecture

**Completed**:
- ✅ Requirements clarification (via upstream GitHub issues)
- ✅ SQL:1999 standard research
- ✅ Testing strategy design
- ✅ Documentation infrastructure

**Next Steps**:
1. Architecture design for core components
2. Language and tooling selection (ADR-0001, ADR-0002)
3. Project scaffolding
4. Phase 1: Core SQL Parser implementation

## Key Findings

### Requirements (Clarified)
- **Standard**: SQL:1999 (not SQL-92 or later versions)
- **Compliance**: FULL (all core + optional features) - unprecedented goal
- **Protocols**: Both ODBC and JDBC required for test execution
- **Testing**: Must pass "NIST compatibility tests" via GitHub Actions

### Critical Discovery
⚠️ **No official NIST SQL:1999 test suite exists** - NIST Test Suite V6.0 only covers SQL-92. Solution: Hybrid approach using sqllogictest (7M+ baseline tests) + custom SQL:1999 feature tests.

### Scope Assessment
- Estimated: 92,000-152,000 lines of code
- Timeline: 3-5 person-years for expert developers
- Challenge: No existing database achieves FULL SQL:1999 compliance
- Approach: Incremental development with AI assistance
