# Major Challenges and Solutions

This document tracks significant challenges encountered during development and how they were solved.

## Purpose

Learning from difficulties helps us:
- Avoid repeating mistakes
- Build institutional knowledge
- Help future contributors
- Document problem-solving approaches

## Format

Each challenge entry includes:
- **Challenge**: What was the problem?
- **Context**: When/where did it occur?
- **Impact**: How did it affect development?
- **Root Cause**: Why did it happen?
- **Solution**: How did we solve it?
- **Prevention**: How to avoid similar issues?
- **Related**: Links to code, docs, issues

## Planning Phase Challenges

### Challenge 1: No Official SQL:1999 Test Suite

**Context**: Discovered during testing strategy research (Week 1)

**Problem**: Requirement states "pass NIST compatibility tests" but official NIST SQL Test Suite only covers SQL-92, not SQL:1999.

**Impact**:
- Cannot use official test suite as sole validation
- Must build custom test infrastructure
- Adds significant work to project scope

**Root Cause**:
- NIST SQL Testing Service terminated before SQL:1999
- No organization created official SQL:1999 conformance tests
- Test suite development is a major undertaking (not done by standards body)

**Solution**: Hybrid testing approach
1. **sqllogictest**: Use existing 7M+ test suite for baseline SQL coverage
2. **Custom SQL:1999 tests**: Build feature-by-feature tests organized by SQL:1999 feature codes
3. **PostgreSQL tests**: Leverage existing open-source database tests
4. **Dual-protocol execution**: Run all tests through both ODBC and JDBC

**Prevention**:
- Always verify availability of assumed resources early in planning
- Research test infrastructure before committing to implementation approach
- Have backup plans for critical dependencies

**Status**: Resolved with documented testing strategy

### Challenge 2: Scope Underestimation

**Context**: Initial project assessment (Week 1)

**Problem**: Initially thought "SQL database" was a well-defined, achievable project. Research revealed unprecedented scope.

**Impact**:
- Estimated 92,000-152,000 LOC
- 3-5 person-years for expert developers
- FULL SQL:1999 compliance never achieved by any existing database
- Both ODBC and JDBC protocols required

**Root Cause**:
- Didn't fully understand SQL:1999 standard initially
- "FULL compliance" includes rarely-implemented optional features
- Protocol implementations are substantial projects themselves
- Underappreciated complexity of query optimization, transactions, etc.

**Solution**:
1. **Phased approach**: Break into 7 clear phases
2. **Incremental development**: Build core features first, add optional later
3. **AI assistance**: Leverage Claude Code for implementation help
4. **Documentation**: Track progress and lessons to manage complexity
5. **Realistic expectations**: Acknowledge this is a multi-year effort

**Prevention**:
- Do thorough scope research before committing to timelines
- Research similar projects to understand effort required
- Break large projects into phases from the start
- Set realistic expectations about difficulty

**Status**: Resolved with adjusted expectations and phased plan

## Lessons from Challenges

### General Patterns

1. **Research First**: Many challenges avoided by thorough upfront research
2. **Ask Questions**: Clarifying requirements prevents wasted work
3. **Document Everything**: Writing down challenges helps solve them
4. **Incremental Approach**: Break large problems into smaller pieces
5. **Leverage Existing Work**: Don't rebuild what already exists

### Red Flags to Watch For

- Ambiguous requirements (get clarification)
- Assumed resources (verify availability)
- Underestimated scope (do detailed breakdown)
- Novel problems (allow extra time)
- Critical dependencies (have backup plans)
