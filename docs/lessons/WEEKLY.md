## Week 1: October 21-25, 2024

### Focus
Planning, requirements clarification, and documentation infrastructure

### Progress
- ✅ Opened 7 GitHub issues for requirements clarification
- ✅ Received responses from upstream maintainer
- ✅ Completed comprehensive research on SQL:1999 standard
- ✅ Designed hybrid testing strategy
- ✅ Created documentation infrastructure with templates
- ✅ Documented all findings in 6 major documents

### Key Lessons

#### 1. Requirements Clarification is Critical
Opening GitHub issues early provided clarity on:
- SQL:1999 (not SQL-92 or later)
- FULL compliance (unprecedented)
- Both ODBC and JDBC required

**Impact**: Clear requirements prevent wasted effort implementing wrong features.

#### 2. Test Suite Gap Discovery
Found that NIST SQL Test Suite only covers SQL-92, not SQL:1999.

**Solution**: Hybrid approach with sqllogictest + custom tests.

**Lesson**: Verify availability of assumed resources early.

#### 3. Documentation from Day One
Created comprehensive docs structure before coding.

**Benefit**: Templates and guides will support the entire project lifecycle.

**Lesson**: Documentation infrastructure pays off for large projects.

### Challenges

#### Challenge: Understanding SQL:1999 Scope
**Problem**: Initially underestimated the complexity.

**Discovery**: 2000+ page spec, ~169 Core features, dozens of optional features.

**Impact**: Adjusted expectations and timeline.

**Solution**: Incremental approach with clear phases.

### SQL:1999 Discoveries
- Three-valued logic (TRUE/FALSE/UNKNOWN) affects all predicates
- IS vs = for Boolean comparisons matters
- Recursive queries require cycle detection
- SIMILAR TO is different from LIKE

### Resources Found
- SQL:1999 BNF grammar (free at ronsavage.github.io)
- "SQL-99 Complete, Really" book (free)
- sqllogictest-rs (7M+ tests)
- Mimer SQL validator
- PostgreSQL source as reference

### Next Week
1. Design overall system architecture
2. Make language selection decision (ADR-0001)
3. Choose parser strategy (ADR-0002)
4. Create initial project structure
5. Begin Phase 1: SQL Parser

### Statistics
- **Documents created**: 13
- **Lines documented**: ~2,700
- **Research time**: Extensive
- **Code written**: 0 (planning phase)
