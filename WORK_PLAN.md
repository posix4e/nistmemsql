# Work Plan: Next Steps

**Status**: Phase 1 In Progress - TDD Foundation Building
**Last Updated**: 2024-10-25
**Current Phase**: Phase 1 (Foundation)
**Development Approach**: Test-Driven Development (TDD) ‚úÖ

## What We've Accomplished

‚úÖ **Planning Complete** (Phase 0)
- Requirements clarified (all 7 GitHub issues answered)
- SQL:1999 standard researched
- Testing strategy designed (sqltest)
- Documentation infrastructure created
- Major simplifications identified (60-70% scope reduction)
- Language chosen (Rust - ADR-0001)
- Cargo workspace initialized (7 crates)

‚úÖ **Types Crate Complete** (TDD Cycle 1) - 27 tests passing
- DataType enum with all SQL:1999 basic types
- SqlValue enum for runtime values
- Type compatibility checking (is_compatible_with)
- NULL handling and three-valued logic foundation
- Display formatting for SQL values
- Comprehensive test coverage for all type operations

‚úÖ **AST Crate Complete** (TDD Cycle 2) - 22 tests passing
- Statement enum: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE TABLE
- Expression enum: Literals, ColumnRef, BinaryOp, UnaryOp, Function, IsNull
- SelectStmt with full clause support (from, where, group_by, having, order_by)
- BinaryOperator and UnaryOperator enums
- FromClause with JOIN support
- OrderByItem with direction support

‚úÖ **Development Tooling**
- rustfmt configured (100 char width, Unix newlines)
- clippy configured (complexity threshold 30)
- Zero warnings, 49 tests passing total

## What's Next: Immediate Priorities

### Priority 1: Parser Strategy Decision (ADR-0002)

**Task**: Choose SQL parser generator/library

**Options to Evaluate**:
1. **pest** - PEG parser, good for complex grammars
2. **lalrpop** - LR parser generator, more traditional
3. **nom** - Parser combinators, very flexible

**Decision Criteria**:
- SQL:1999 grammar complexity handling
- Error message quality
- Development speed
- Community support and examples
- Integration with our AST types

**Deliverable**: `docs/decisions/0002-parser-strategy.md`

**Time Estimate**: 2-4 hours (research + decision doc)

---

### Priority 2: Build Basic Parser (parser crate)

**Task**: Implement SQL parser using chosen generator (from ADR-0002)

**What to Build** (Incremental):

#### Step 1: Simple SELECT Parser
```sql
-- Start with basics
SELECT 42;
SELECT 'hello';
SELECT 1 + 2;
```

#### Step 2: Add WHERE
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1;
SELECT name FROM users WHERE age > 18;
```

#### Step 3: Add Basic Expressions
```sql
SELECT id, name, age FROM users;
SELECT id + 1, name FROM users;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;
```

#### Step 4: Expand gradually
- Joins
- Subqueries
- Aggregates
- More complex expressions

**Deliverable**: Parser that produces AST for basic SQL

**Time Estimate**: 8-12 hours for initial parser

---

## Phase 1 Roadmap (4-6 weeks estimated)

### Week 1: Foundation (IN PROGRESS ‚úÖ)
- [x] ADR-0002: Choose parser strategy (NEXT UP)
- [x] Implement types crate (basic types) - 27 tests passing ‚úÖ
- [x] Implement ast crate (core structures) - 22 tests passing ‚úÖ
- [ ] Set up parser with chosen tool
- [ ] Parse simple SELECT statements

**Progress**: 2 of 5 tasks complete, TDD approach proven successful!

**Next Milestone**: `SELECT 42;` parses to AST

### Week 2-3: Core SQL Parsing
- [ ] Add all SQL:1999 data types to types crate
- [ ] Expand AST for all statement types
- [ ] Implement full SELECT parsing (no joins yet)
- [ ] Add INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE parsing
- [ ] CREATE TABLE parsing

**Milestone**: Basic DML/DDL statements parse ‚úÖ

### Week 3-4: Complex Parsing
- [ ] JOIN operations
- [ ] Subqueries
- [ ] Aggregate functions
- [ ] Expression evaluation in parser
- [ ] Type checking in semantic analysis

**Milestone**: Complex SELECTs with joins parse ‚úÖ

### Week 5-6: SQL:1999 Features
- [ ] CASE expressions
- [ ] CAST operations
- [ ] Boolean type support
- [ ] WITH (common table expressions)
- [ ] Window functions (if time)

**Milestone**: Most SQL:1999 Core features parse ‚úÖ

---

## Immediate Next Session Plan

### Session Goal: Make Parser Strategy Decision + Start Types Crate

**Tasks**:
1. **Research parser options** (1-2 hours)
   - Read pest documentation and examples
   - Read lalrpop documentation and examples
   - Look for SQL grammar examples for each
   - Evaluate based on decision criteria

2. **Create ADR-0002** (1 hour)
   - Document options
   - Make decision (likely pest or lalrpop)
   - Explain rationale
   - Update DECISIONS.md

3. **Start types crate** (2-3 hours)
   - Implement basic DataType enum
   - Implement basic SqlValue enum
   - Add tests for type operations
   - Document in crate README

**End Goal**: Have parser tool chosen and types crate started

**Estimated Total Time**: 4-6 hours

---

## Success Metrics

### Phase 1 Complete When:
- [ ] All basic SQL statements parse correctly
- [ ] AST accurately represents SQL:1999 structures
- [ ] Type system supports all SQL:1999 data types
- [ ] Parser has comprehensive error messages
- [ ] All parser tests pass
- [ ] Can parse 50+ different SQL queries

### Quality Gates:
- All code passes `cargo clippy` (no warnings)
- All tests pass (`cargo test`)
- Documentation complete for each crate
- No compiler warnings
- Clear error messages for invalid SQL

---

## Risk Management

### Known Risks

**Risk 1: SQL Grammar Complexity**
- SQL:1999 grammar is huge and ambiguous
- **Mitigation**: Start simple, iterate, use existing grammar as reference
- **Fallback**: Simplify grammar where standard allows flexibility

**Risk 2: Parser Generator Learning Curve**
- New tool, need to learn
- **Mitigation**: Start with tutorials, simple examples
- **Fallback**: Can switch tools if one proves too difficult

**Risk 3: Type System Complexity**
- User-defined types, arrays, nested structures
- **Mitigation**: Implement incrementally (basic ‚Üí advanced)
- **Fallback**: Phase 4 can handle advanced types

---

## Questions to Answer

### Before Starting Parser:
- [ ] Which parser generator? (ADR-0002)
- [ ] Do we have SQL:1999 grammar reference?
- [ ] What's our test strategy for the parser?

### Before Starting Types:
- [ ] Start with all types or incrementally?
- [ ] How to handle type coercion rules?
- [ ] What about NULL handling in type system?

### Architecture Questions:
- [ ] How do crates depend on each other?
- [ ] Where does semantic analysis happen?
- [ ] How to structure error types?

---

## Resources Needed

### SQL:1999 Grammar
- [ ] SQL:1999 BNF from ronsavage.github.io ‚úÖ (already found)
- [ ] Example grammars from pest/lalrpop projects
- [ ] PostgreSQL grammar as reference

### Parser Examples
- [ ] Find existing SQL parsers in Rust
- [ ] Look at pest SQL examples
- [ ] Look at lalrpop SQL examples

### Documentation
- [ ] Rust Book for reference
- [ ] Parser tool docs (based on ADR-0002 choice)
- [ ] SQL:1999 standard sections on types

**Questions for Discussion**:
1. Does this work plan make sense?
2. Should we do ADR-0002 first, or start types crate in parallel?
3. Any adjustments to priorities or timeline?
4. Ready to begin Phase 1?
